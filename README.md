## Simple PostgreSQL deployment on k8s

### Introduction

This definistion file provides a simply PostgreSQL deployment on Kubernetes cluster. In this example we understand some basic concepts of k8s and how these are applied to deploy a single postgres instance. On kubernetes the containers are run in the PODs. Pods are the smallest distributable compute units you can create and manage in Kubernetes. Deployments give us agility to scale, upgrade and update our application, so not in this case but in solution where is implemented a cluster database provide us HA and business continuity.
